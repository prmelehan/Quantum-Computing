# Quantum Computing

### Using IBM QX to explore Quantum Computing


### Background

I'll be looking at different ways to improve algorithmic efficiency for various different types of classical computing algorithms.


### Explanations

I'm also trying to understand and illustrate different Quantum Properties as well as possible to further my understanding as well as inform others. I'm going to explain Super Position, Entanglement, as well as Pauli, and Hadamard Gates.
